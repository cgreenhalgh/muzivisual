            <h4 id="intro" class='anchor'>Overview</h4>
            <p>
                Climb! is a musical composition that combines the ideas of a classical virtuoso piece and a computer game. Written for a
                Disklavier grand piano, the work engages the pianist in an unusual musical dialogue where there is no fixed
                musical form: the performer’s/gamer’s actions define how the story continues. As the performer plays key
                passages, so both the music and the instrument respond, jumping to new points in the score, transforming
                the sound, or independently playing along with them – physically in the case of the Disklavier. An interactive
                system like this resembles “an invisible chamber music partner” leading some musicians to claim that electroacoustic
                works can never be treated as solo compositions, but should instead be seen as “concertos in a modern guise”.
                Like a computer game or the World Wide Web, Climb! is non-linear, with a branching structure that allows
                the performer to choose different routes through the work. It consists of three macro-compositions called
                paths with some further side paths between them. Various micro-compositions are then dispersed along each
                path. Depending on how the performer plays, they may continue to progress along their current path or be
                diverted onto another one.

            <p>
                <b>Dr. Maria Kallionpää (1981)</b> is an internationally active composer and pianist. She earned her PhD
                in composition at the university of Oxford in 2015. Kallionpää won the first prize of the OUPHIL composition
                competition in 2013. She has graduated from the Royal Academy of Music (2009) and Universität für Musik und
                Darstellende Kunst Wien (2010) and has also studied composition and piano at Sibelius Academy and Universität
                Mozarteum Salzburg. Her works have been performed at Musikverein Wien, Philharmonie Luxembourg, and Sibiu
                Philharmonia. In 2011 Kallionpää was a commissioned composer of the Turku European Culture Capital and a
                finalist of the Tenso European Chamber Choir Composition Competition. Kallionpää has performed at numerous
                music festivals including Rainy Days Festival at Philharmonie Luxembourg, Musica Nova (Helsinki), Spitalfields
                Festival (London), and Neue Musik von Thuringen. In 2016 her music was performed at the Florida International
                Toy Piano Festival.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kallionpää currently works as a postdoctoral fellow at the university of Aalborg and as a composer in residence of the Mixed
                Reality Laboratory of the Nottingham University. Her artistic research project focuses on designing a music
                engine that uses gamification as a composition technique. Kallionpää is a winner of the Fabbrica Young Artist
                Development Program of Opera di Roma, for which she is currently composing a new opera that will be premiered
                in 2017. Moreover, in collaboration with her colleague Markku Klami, Kallionpää is also working on the first
                full-length puppet opera produced in the Nordic Countries, which will premiere in 2018. Kallionpää was a
                laureate of Académie de France à Rome in 2016.

            <h4 id="tech" class="anchor"> About the technology Climb! </h4>
            <p>
                Climb! Is realised using a combination of technologies. It is played on a Disklavier piano that can be instructed to physically
                play back computer generated parts (using the MIDI protocol) and can even duet along with the pianist, moving
                its keys around and between their fingers. Climb! also uses the Max/MSP software running on a laptop to generate
                various audio effects that transform the piano’s sound.
            </p>
            <p>
                The performer controls how the work progresses – which path they follow and how they negotiate various events along the way
                – directly through their playing rather than by pressing buttons, pushing pedals or having someone do this
                from behind the scenes. This employs a technology called Muzicodes1 from the University of Nottingham’s Mixed
                Reality Lab. Muzicodes allows certain phrases in the score to be designated as hidden codes that, when successfully
                played by the pianist, trigger events such as jumping to a new place in the score (like following a hyperlink
                on the World Wide Web); introducing an audio effect to represent weather, animals, stones and so forth; causing
                the Disklavier to duet with the pianist; driving the projected animations; and finally controlling these
                very programme notes!
            </p>
            <p>
                The MELD software from the University of Oxford is used to render the pianist’s score, turning the digital pages for them
                as they negotiate their route through the piece.
